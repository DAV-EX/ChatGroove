# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client is built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, using Vite as the build tool. The UI follows a modern component-based architecture:
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management with optimistic updates and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible design
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming support
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

The architecture separates concerns with dedicated folders for pages, components (chat, profile, ui), hooks, and utilities. The component structure emphasizes reusability and follows atomic design principles.

## Backend Architecture
The server uses **Express.js** with TypeScript in ESM format:
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints organized by resource (auth, users, chats, messages)
- **Middleware**: Custom logging, error handling, and authentication middleware
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based approach for message updates (2-5 second intervals)
- **File Structure**: Modular design with separate files for routes, storage layer, database connection, and authentication

## Data Storage
**PostgreSQL** with **Drizzle ORM** for reliable relational database operations:
- **Schema Design**: Type-safe relational schema with proper foreign key relationships
- **Tables**: Users, chats, messages, and sessions with JSONB for flexible participant management
- **Connection**: PostgreSQL with WebSocket support via Neon serverless driver
- **ORM Features**: Automatic schema generation, type-safe queries, and migrations

## Authentication System
**JWT-based authentication** with **Google OAuth** integration:
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Google OAuth**: Full Google sign-in integration with automatic account linking
- **Email Verification**: SMTP-based email verification system
- **Role Management**: User, moderator, and admin roles with permission-based access control
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing for secure password storage

## Chat System Architecture
**Multi-participant chat support** with comprehensive messaging features:
- **Message Types**: Text, image, file, voice note, video note, video call, and audio call support
- **Read Receipts**: Track message read status per user with timestamps
- **Online Status**: Real-time user presence indicators with last seen timestamps
- **Global Rooms**: Public chat rooms with categories (General, Gaming, Music, Technology, Creative, Food & Travel)
- **Group Management**: Create, join, and manage group conversations
- **Direct Messages**: Private one-on-one conversations
- **Message History**: Paginated message loading with proper ordering and reply support

## Admin Dashboard
**Comprehensive administrative interface** for platform management:
- **User Management**: View, edit roles, and delete user accounts
- **Chat Moderation**: Monitor and delete inappropriate chat rooms
- **Message Moderation**: Review and remove individual messages
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Real-time metrics for users, chats, and messages
- **Role Assignment**: Promote users to moderator or admin status
- **Access Control**: Admin-only routes with proper authentication middleware

## Development Tools
