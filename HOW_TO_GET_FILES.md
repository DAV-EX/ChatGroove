# How to Get ChatGroove Files from Replit

## Method 1: Three-dot Menu (Most Common)
1. In the Replit editor, look for the three-dot menu (...) in the Files panel
2. Click on it and look for "Download as ZIP" or "Export"
3. This should download the entire project

## Method 2: Right-click on Project Root
1. In the Files panel, right-click on the main project folder
2. Look for "Download" or "Export as ZIP" option
3. Select it to download the complete project

## Method 3: Shell/Terminal Method (Alternative)
If the GUI methods don't work, you can create a manual archive:
1. Open the Shell tab in Replit
2. Run these commands:
```bash
# Create a zip of the entire project
zip -r chatgroove-export.zip . -x "node_modules/*" ".cache/*" ".git/*" "*.log"

# This will create chatgroove-export.zip with all your code
```
3. The zip file will appear in your Files panel
4. Right-click on it to download

## Method 4: Individual File Copy (Last Resort)
If all else fails, you can manually copy key files:
- package.json (dependencies)
- All files in client/src/
- All files in server/
- shared/schema.ts
- Configuration files (vite.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts, etc.)

## What You Need for Deployment
The essential files for ChatGroove:
- package.json & package-lock.json
- client/ folder (React frontend)
- server/ folder (Express backend) 
- shared/ folder (TypeScript schemas)
- Configuration files
- DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (I created this for you)

## After Getting Files
1. Extract to local folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Set up PostgreSQL database
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy to Railway, Render, or Vercel

Try Method 1 or 2 first - the export option should be somewhere in the Files panel interface.
